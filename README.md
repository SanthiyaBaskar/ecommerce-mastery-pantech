## 💡 Personal Reflection

This course was one of the most impactful practical trainings I’ve taken. It wasn’t just theoretical — I actually built a **live shopping website** with login features, product management, and payment support. It made me confident about tackling real-world freelance and team projects.

The **hands-on structure** helped me understand not only *how* things work but *why* each tool is used in the development stack.
